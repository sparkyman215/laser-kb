# Laser-85
### A GMK Laser inspired case, in a custom 85-key handwired ortholinear package.

## the plan  

Design and print case with http://builder.swillkb.com/, steel switchplate cut by Lasergist, acrylic cut by Ponoko.    
Philosophy for layers is the ability to only have to use one hand while using modifiers.  

| Layer | Type   | Material       | Width |
|:-----:|:------:|:--------------:|:-----:|
|   1   | Switch | Steel          | 1.5mm |
|   2   | Closed | Purple Acrylic | ~3mm  |
|   3   | Open   | Purple Acrylic | ~3mm  |
|   4   | Open   | Blue Acrylic   | ~4mm  |
|   5   | Closed | Purple Acrylic | ~3mm  |
|   6   | Closed | Purple Acrylic | ~3mm  |
|   7   | Bottom | Blue Acrylic   | ~4mm  |
|       |        | Total Inside   | ~13mm |
|       |        | Total          | ~20mm |

Total would be less if tools are already owned, and also some items (like 300 pack of diodes) aren't used in entirety and the real cost is less
